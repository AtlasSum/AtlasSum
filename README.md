- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtlasSum
- 👀 I’m interested in discovering what github is about since i know nothing about coding, programming and all the hacker stuff. But i like to use techonology and i think that it can help humanity (if used correctly) to achieve greater goals. So here I am in this world. I am 26 years old, and i started to get very interested because i heard here gather all the tech bros.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning evrything... I know absolutely nothing. But i want to break the matrix
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well.. i would like to know if it's possibile to create a special smartphone to hack stuff and not to be detected or tracked (this to start, then i have other ideas)
- 📫 How to reach me : my mail.
